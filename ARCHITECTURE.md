# Architecture: Glue Application Browser

## The Big Idea

**Native mobile and desktop applications** built on the same principle as a web browser — but instead of HTML/CSS/JS interpreted by a browser, everything is **Glue** interpreted by a native Flutter runtime.

In a web browser the server delivers pages as executable programs (HTML + JS) and the browser renders them natively. Here, the server delivers UI and logic as Glue programs and the native app renders them as Flutter widgets. The app itself contains no application logic — it is a universal Glue runtime that happens to run natively on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

The server owns all domain logic, UI definitions, and application state. The client exposes its native capabilities (navigation, platform UI, local state) back to the server through Glue.

Crucially, **both sides can call functions on the other**. The server can remotely invoke client-side capabilities (navigate to a screen, show a dialog, trigger a platform animation). The client can invoke server-side capabilities (fetch a resource, submit an action, query domain data). The WebSocket is a **bidirectional Glue RPC channel**.

## Core Principle: Symmetric Glue RPC

Both sides **expose capabilities** as functions in their Glue environments, and both sides **invoke the other's capabilities** by sending Glue expressions over the WebSocket.

| Direction | What it enables |
|---|---|
| Client → Server | `(get 'id)` — request resources, submit actions, query domain data |
| Server → Client | `(put 'id body)` — push resources, trigger navigation, update state |

Neither side is purely passive. The server can drive the client at any time — navigate, update state, invoke any function the client has registered in its Glue environment.

---

## The Resource Store

The client maintains a single **keyed reactive store** of Glue values. Both state and screens live here, identified by ID. There is no distinction at the storage level — both are `Ir` values wrapped in `StateNotifier`.

| ID | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `'user-profile` | `(:name "Alice" :age 30 ...)` | State |
| `'cart` | `((:id "p1" :qty 2) ...)` | State |
| `'notifications` | `(...)` | State |
| `'home-screen` | `(listen user-profile (\ () ...))` | Screen |
| `'cart-screen` | `(listen cart (\ () ...))` | Screen |
| `'profile-screen` | `(listen user-profile (\ () ...))` | Screen |

### State Resources
Pure data delivered by the server. Stored as Glue values. When updated, all screens that listen to them re-render automatically.

### Screen Resources
Glue expressions that produce UI. A screen is **not a lambda over state** — it is a `listen` expression that subscribes to one or more state IDs and re-renders its body whenever those state values change:

```clojure
(listen user-profile
  (lambda ()
    ((def user (read user-profile))
     (column
        (text user.name)
        (text user.plan)))))
```

- `listen` establishes the reactive subscription for the client's `Listenable` widget
- The inner `lambda` takes no arguments — it binds the current state value via `def` and accesses its properties with dot notation
- When the `StateNotifier` for `'user-profile` fires, the lambda is re-evaluated and the widget tree updates

This is analogous to reactive signals or `useSelector` in React, but expressed entirely in Glue and defined server-side.

### Compositional Screens: Sub-Resources

Screens are composed from smaller fragments using `lookup` + `listen`. `lookup` is the core storage primitive — given a quoted symbol ID, it returns a `StateNotifier` from the store. Its resolution order is:

1. **In-memory store** → return existing `StateNotifier` immediately
2. **Persistent cache** → evaluate the cached Glue source, populate the store, return notifier
3. **Not found** → register a placeholder `StateNotifier`, send `(get 'id)` to the server; when `(put 'id body)` arrives the client persists to cache, evaluates, and updates the notifier → all `listen` subscribers re-render automatically

```clojure
(def header-widget     (lookup 'header-widget))
(def user-stats-widget (lookup 'user-stats-widget))

(listen user-profile
  (lambda ()
    (column
      (listen header-widget
        (lambda () (read header-widget)))
      (listen user-stats-widget
        (lambda ()
          (def user-stats (read user-stats-widget))
          (user-stats (read user-profile)))))))
```

| ID | Role |
|---|---|
| `'home-screen` | Screen (top-level) |
| `'header-widget` | Screen fragment (sub-resource) |
| `'user-stats-widget` | Screen fragment (sub-resource) |
| `'user-profile` | State |

- `lookup` is called once per resource — returns the `StateNotifier` and triggers a server fetch if needed
- `listen` attaches a reactive lambda to a `StateNotifier` — re-runs on every value change
- `read` reads the current value of the notifier inside a `listen` body
- `listen` can be nested — each sub-tree re-renders independently when its own state changes

This enables **incremental, compositional UI delivery**:
- Fragments are fetched lazily and cached; server updates re-render only the affected fragment
- Fragments can be shared across multiple parent screens
- Each `listen` node is an independent reactive boundary

---

## The Wire Protocol

Messages in both directions are Glue expressions sent as plain text over the WebSocket.

### Client → Server
```clojure
(get 'home-screen)              ;; request a resource
(get 'user-profile)             ;; request state data
```

### Server → Client
```clojure
(put 'user-profile (:name "Alice" :age 30 :plan "pro"))
(put 'home-screen  (listen user-profile (lambda () (column ...))))
(navigate 'cart-screen)         ;; invoke client function directly
(show-dialog :title "New order" :body "...")
```

The server can send both resource deliveries (`put`) and direct client function invocations in the same channel.

---

## The Resource Lifecycle

### 1. Request
The client needs a resource by ID. Checks in-memory store first.

- **Cache hit** → `StateNotifier` already holds the value; UI is live immediately
- **Cache miss** → client sends `(get 'id)` to the server over WebSocket

### 2. Fetch & Execute (Server)
The server receives the `get` expression, evaluates it in its domain environment, and produces a Glue result — a state value, a screen expression, or a mix.

### 3. Deliver
The server sends `(put 'id body)` back to the client. `body` is the complete Glue source for the resource.

### 4. Cache & Render (Client)
1. Client **persists** the Glue source text locally (keyed by ID) — survives restarts
2. Client **evaluates** the Glue in its Flutter environment
3. Result stored in the **reactive state store** under the resource ID
4. `StateNotifier` fires → all `listen` subscriptions re-render automatically

### 5. Interact
User interactions invoke Glue action expressions — some run locally (client environment), some dispatch to the server. Server may respond with updated `put` messages **and** direct client invocations (e.g., `(navigate 'order-details :id "order-123")` after a successful submit).

---

## Server-Initiated Client Calls

The server is not limited to responding to requests. At any time it can push Glue expressions that invoke registered client functions:

```clojure
(navigate 'order-details :id "order-123")
(show-dialog :title "New message" :body "...")
(put 'cart (:items () :total 0))    ;; clear cart state
```

The client's Glue Controller evaluates these in the client environment — navigation happens, dialogs appear, state updates fire. This enables **full server-driven application flow**, not just server-driven content.

---

## The Two Controllers

|  | Client Controller | Server Controller |
|---|---|---|
| **Input** | Glue text from server via WebSocket | Glue text from client via WebSocket |
| **What it does** | Parse → persist → eval in Flutter env → update state store | Parse → eval in server domain env → serialize result |
| **Output** | Live widgets via `StateNotifier` + `listen` | Glue text (`put` / function calls) |
| **Environment** | Flutter UI modules, `listen`, `read`, `lookup`, navigation, state store | Domain modules: repositories, services, business logic |

---

## Separation of Concerns

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Server** | All domain knowledge, all UI structure, all business rules, application flow — in Glue |
| **Client** | Glue runtime, Flutter rendering, reactive store, local capabilities — fully generic |
| **Glue** | Shared language, wire protocol, and RPC mechanism |

---

## Startup Behaviour

On cold start, before the WebSocket connects:

1. Load all persisted Glue sources from local persistent storage
2. Compile and evaluate each in the Flutter environment
3. Populate the reactive state store
4. `listen` subscriptions activate — UI renders immediately from cache (**no loading flash**)

Once connected, the server pushes fresh resources and can initiate application flow remotely.

---

## Why Glue as the Protocol?

- **No custom message schemas** — both sides speak the same language
- **Executable behaviour travels over the wire** — not just data, but reactive expressions, lambdas, and composition
- **Symmetric** — same mechanism for both directions, `get` and `put`
- **Extensible** — new capabilities require only registering new functions in the respective environment
- **The client is fully generic** — zero application-specific code on the client

---

## Summary

This is **SDUI taken to its logical extreme** with **bidirectional Glue RPC**. The store holds both state (data) and screens (reactive Glue expressions using `listen`). Screens use `lookup` to bind `StateNotifier`s for any resource ID — triggering lazy fetches from the server when needed — and `listen` to subscribe reactively. Each `listen` is an independent re-render boundary. The client is a runtime, not an application.
